# web-stack-implementation-lemp
a new repo for lemp project


Howdy ya'll,welcome to the Web Stack Implementation using LEMP Stack in Azure project.

In this project, we will be using the LEMP stack! You may be wondering, what is LEMP?

    L stands for Linux Operating system
    E stands for Nginx web server (pronounced as engine-x, hence the E in the acronym)
    M stands for MySQL database
    P stands for PHP scripting language.

Here is a brief description of each component:

Linux is an operating system that manages the underlying hardware on your PC. It is an open-source software that is used worldwide and there are many distributions of it (e.g. Ubuntu, CentOS, etc). It is flexible and easy to configure.

Nginx is an HTTP proxy application that can deliver high performance by handling an increased load of HTTP requests (especially compared to Apache).

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.

PHP is a scripting language on the server-side used for the creation of static or dynamic web sites or Web applications.

Now that you know the components that we're using, let's get started!
